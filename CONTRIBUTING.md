## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to this project:

- **Code contributions**: Implement new features or fix bugs
- **Documentation**: Improve or extend documentation
- **Bug reports**: Submit detailed bug reports
- **Feature requests**: Suggest new features or improvements
- **Reviews**: Review pull requests from other contributors
- **Discussions**: Participate in discussions and help shape the project

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flutterrific_opentelemetry.git
   cd flutterrific_opentelemetry
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/flutterrific_opentelemetry.git
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```
4. Run the analyzer:
   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   ```
5. Format your code:
   ```bash
   dart format .
   ```
6. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```
7. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
8. Create a pull request to the main repository

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md or other documentation with details of changes if appropriate
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with a description of your changes
3. The PR should work with the latest version of Flutter and be compatible with all supported platforms (Android, iOS, Web)
4. The PR will be merged once it receives approval from project maintainers

## Coding Standards

### Code Style

This project follows the official [Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and uses the standard Dart formatting tool (`dart format`).

### Linting Rules

We use the recommended Flutter linting rules. Always run `flutter analyze` before submitting a PR to ensure your code follows these rules.

### Testing

All new code should be covered by tests. We use the `flutter_test` package for writing and running tests.

- All tests should be in the `test` directory
- Test files should end with `_test.dart`
- Run tests with `flutter test`
- Widget tests should use `flutter_test` testing utilities
- Unit tests for non-Flutter code should use the `test` package

### Documentation

- All public APIs must have dartdoc comments
- Comments should explain "why" not just "what"
- Example usage is encouraged for complex functionality
- Flutter-specific documentation should include widget usage examples

## Flutter-Specific Considerations

### Platform Support

When contributing to this Flutter SDK:

1. Consider all supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web, Desktop
2. Test on multiple platforms when possible
3. Handle platform-specific limitations gracefully
4. Use conditional imports when necessary for platform-specific code

### Widget Integration

- Follow Flutter's widget composition patterns
- Use Flutter's lifecycle methods appropriately
- Consider performance implications for widget rebuilds
- Provide easy-to-use widget extensions when appropriate

### Navigation Integration

- Support multiple navigation patterns (Navigator 1.0, Navigator 2.0, third-party routers)
- Make navigation integration optional and configurable
- Document integration patterns for popular routing packages

## Specification Compliance

Since this project implements the OpenTelemetry specification for Flutter:

1. All implementations must strictly follow the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/)
2. Any deviations from the specification must be clearly documented and justified
3. Follow the semantic conventions defined by OpenTelemetry
4. Ensure compatibility with the OpenTelemetry Collector
5. Support standard OTLP exporters

## Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages that explain the changes you've made. Follow these guidelines:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Issue Process

### Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

- A clear, descriptive title
- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected behavior and actual behavior
- Your environment (Flutter version, Dart version, platform, device info, etc.)
- If possible, a minimal code example that demonstrates the issue
- Console logs or error messages

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. Please provide:

- A clear, descriptive title
- A detailed description of the proposed feature
- An explanation of why this feature would be useful for Flutter developers
- Example use cases
- If possible, outline how the feature might be implemented
- Consider how the feature would work across different Flutter platforms

## Release Process

The release process is handled by project maintainers. If you're a maintainer, follow these steps:

1. Update version in `pubspec.yaml`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes since the last release
3. Create a release commit
4. Tag the release commit with the version number (e.g., `v0.3.0`)
5. Push the commit and tag to the repository
6. Publish to pub.dev:
   ```bash
   flutter pub publish
   ```

## Communication

- GitHub Issues: For bug reports, feature requests, and general discussions
- Pull Requests: For code contributions and reviews

## Dependencies and Compatibility

- Keep dependencies minimal and well-justified
- Ensure compatibility with supported Flutter versions
- Test with the latest stable and beta Flutter releases
- Consider the impact of dependency updates on users
