- [ ] Update documentation website (if applicable)
- [ ] Increment to next development version
- [ ] Update any dependent packages to use the new version
- [ ] Notify users of any migration requirements

## Flutter-Specific Release Considerations

### Platform Testing

- [ ] Test on real iOS devices (multiple iOS versions)
- [ ] Test in web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- [ ] Test on desktop platforms (if supported)
- [ ] Verify performance on different device classes

### Framework Integration

- [ ] Test widget extensions and tracking
- [ ] Verify app lifecycle tracking works across platforms

### Ecosystem Compatibility
- [ ] Test with popular state management solutions
- [ ] Verify compatibility with common navigation packages
- [ ] Test with popular networking packages
- [ ] Check integration with crash reporting tools

## Emergency Fixes

If an emergency fix is required for a released version:

1. Create a hotfix branch from the tagged release
2. Make minimal required changes
3. Test thoroughly on affected platforms
4. Follow the standard release process but increment the PATCH version
5. Merge the fix back to the main branch if applicable
6. Consider backporting to other supported versions

## CNCF Contribution Considerations

If preparing for CNCF contribution:

- [ ] Ensure all legal requirements are met (license, CLAs, etc.)
- [ ] Review contribution guidelines for the OpenTelemetry organization
- [ ] Prepare documentation specifically required for CNCF review
- [ ] Verify compatibility with other OpenTelemetry implementations
- [ ] Ensure governance documents are complete and current
- [ ] Review security policies and procedures
- [ ] Verify project follows CNCF graduation criteria

## Quality Gates

Before any release, ensure:

### Code Quality Gates
- [ ] Test coverage >85%
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet standards
- [ ] Memory usage is within acceptable limits
- [ ] Package size is reasonable for Flutter applications

### Documentation Gates
- [ ] All public APIs are documented
- [ ] Migration guides exist for breaking changes
- [ ] Examples are tested and working
- [ ] Platform-specific considerations are documented

### Community Gates
